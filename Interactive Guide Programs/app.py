#     displacement, velocity and acceleration that are needed to
#     describe the motion of an object along a straight line. We
#     found that the directional aspect of these quantities can be
#     taken care of by + and â€“ signs, as in one dimension only two
#     directions are possible. But in order to describe motion of an
#     object  in  two  dimensions  (a  plane)  or  three  dimensions
#     (space),  we  need  to  use  vectors  to  describe  the  above-
#     mentioned physical quantities.  Therefore, it is first necessary
#     to learn the language of vectors. What is a vector? How to
#     add, subtract and multiply vectors ? What is the result of
#     multiplying a vector by a real number ? We shall learn this
#     to  enable  us  to  use  vectors  for  defining  velocity  and
#     acceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object
#     in a plane.  As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall
#     discuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail
#     the projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of
#     motion that has a special significance in daily-life situations.
#     We shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail.
#     The equations developed in this chapter for motion in a
#     plane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions."""
